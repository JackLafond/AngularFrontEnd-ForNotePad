# AngularFrontEnd-ForNotePad
This front end gave me a chance to learn the Angular framework, and further develop my html and css skills.
Note that the backend must be deployed in order for this note pad to pull any notes.
When back end is running, this front end is fully functional, where you can create, update, and delete notes.
